       y = the minor version number
       z = the patch version number

       Changes to the major version number denote backwards-incompatible
       changes between two revisions of the same module.

       Changes to the minor version number indicate there have been new
       backwards-compatible features introduced in the later version of
       a module.

       Changes to the patch version indicate bug fixes between two
       versions of a module.";
